As some of you may already be aware, the Jefferson Service Center is closed until at least April 14th, depending on further shelter in place orders.  At least for this week, that means that no new Eagle Scout Rank Applications (ESRA) will be processed.  Our council’s support staff are currently on leave and will not be working.  No applications are going to be processed or credentials issued due to the National being closed as well.

**What does this mean to us?**

A.  We can continue working with what we have.
1. Approved ESRAs can be sat for EBoRs via video conference
2. New Eagle Service Projects can be reviewed and approved via email or video conference.

**What happens to scouts who are nearing or have passed the age of 18, and need their ESRA approved?**

A.  We will use the Council level extension for EBoR to deal with this pause in service.

SUGGESTION:  Consider working with these scouts and their leaders to ensure their advancement is entered into IA 2.0 / Scoutbook, so there is no delay when the service center opens.  This is the primary cause of delays.

**Can we hold EBoRs without and approved ESRA?**

A.  NO.  As per the Guide to Advancement, “9.0.1.6 Council Verifies Application and Board of Review Scheduled.”

Please review the FAQs found here - > https://www.scouting.org/coronavirus/covid-19-faq, as a refresher for other time-related challenges.

Please help to bring calm to those who may be a little panicked due to age and expected college dates and military service.  We will take care of them one way or another.  God willing, we’ll be up and running before normal graduation dates.
