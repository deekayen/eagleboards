**Eagle Candidate,**

**Congratulations on being approved to sit your Eagle Scout Board of Review!**

Due to current situation regarding COVID-19, your Board of Review will be conducted by video conference. To help ensure that your Board of Review is conducted smoothly and efficiently, please read and employ the following guidelines to the best of your ability. If you have questions or concerns regarding any of these items, please contact the District Advancement Committee at advancement@etowah-bsa.org.

**_Unit Leader: Please personally send letters of recommendation by separate email to the District Advancement Committee Chair, or identified delegate._** _(Exact instructions will be mentioned within email)_

_At least two days before your Board of Review,_ transmit PDF copies of the following documents to the District Advancement Committee. _(Exact instructions will be mentioned within email)_ It is important these documents be less than 10MB in size to ensure successful delivery. For pictures and scanned items, it is strongly suggested that you paste them into Word or similar software and print or save as PDF. This will help keep file sizes down, as well as reduce the number of document files that need to be created.

**_Be prepared!_** To be ready for your “virtual” Board of Review, you will need the following. Please check or test these items at least an hour before the Board of Review so that you have time to resolve any issues.
* A quiet location in your home free of visual and audible disruptions.
* A copy of the documentation listed above.
* Even though you are at home, the Board of Review members want to see you at your Scouting best, so please wear your Class-A uniform, or the uniform you normally wear to Troop meetings.
* A computer with webcam, speakers, and microphone (or headset, if you choose), successfully tested with Zoom.
    * Check what is appearing in your camera’s view and remove personal, confidential, and inappropriate items that might appear in the background.
    * Check the lighting of the room to make sure that it is sufficient (includes being able to see your face on the camera).
    * Check your internet connection.
    * Check how your name appears in the Zoom meeting and update it accordingly if needed.

Important items to note about conducting your Board of Review via video teleconference:
* The Board of Review will not be recorded, per BSA policy.
* Video is required, and anyone who can hear the event is required to be in the camera view, per BSA policy.
* The Board of Review will be conducted in compliance with BSA Youth Protection
policy, which means:
    * A parent or two registered adult leaders must be directly present and
visible with you at the beginning of the video conference. Once all Board of Review members have joined, anyone else present with you will need to move out of camera view and hearing distance.
    * At the conclusion of the Board of Review, you will be instructed to have your parent(s) or leaders rejoin you. They will need to rejoin before the Board of Review can end.

The District Advancement Team’s goal is to provide you the best experience possible with your virtual Eagle Board of Review. And realize that that the Committee’s goal is to ensure that your Eagle Board of Review will be one of those most cherished moments to remember within your lifetime.
Please reach out if there are any questions. Yours in cheerful service,
