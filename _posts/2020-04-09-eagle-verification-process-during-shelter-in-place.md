First things first, I hope this finds you healthy and well.  Secondly, I want to thank you for recognizing that this is an unprecedented time we are living in. I also appreciate you understanding the need for fluidity in our processes.

Speaking of processes ... In response to the extended Shelter In Place order, we will only be able to verify Eagle Rank Applications one day a week.  This day will be every Thursday and will begin April 16th and last until at least April 30th.  My "office" hours will begin at 9:00 a.m. each Thursday and will last until all the Eagle Applications I have received for that week have been reviewed.

Some important things to know and pass along to any Eagle Candidates:

Due to the office being closed, we CANNOT accept Eagle Applications via:
* In Person Drop-off
* Overnight Services such as Fed Ex, UPS, etc.

We CAN accept them via:
* Electronic Mail: amy.mercer@scouting.org
* Regular US Mail at: P.O. Box 399, Jefferson, GA 30549

We also will need all candidates - regardless of district - to include their Eagle Project Notebook with their Eagle Rank Application. This includes those submitted via e-mail.  The council will scan any notebooks received via US Mail and forward it to the appropriate advancement personnel via email.

**With National Council personnel working from home, they do not have the ability to print and ship Eagle credentials.  I do not know when this will change.**

Please let me know of any questions or things I may have not considered or covered.

Thank you for all you do for Scouting!

Stay safe and Scout On.

Yours in Scouting,

Mrs. Amy R. Mercer
