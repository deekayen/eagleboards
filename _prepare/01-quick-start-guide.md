Appointments for Eagle Board final review can only be scheduled after submitting a completed eagle application to the council office and receiving approval.

Be sure and read the [Twelve Steps from Life to Eagle](/prepare/twelve-steps)

Scouts must schedule their Project Review or Board of Review by the 3rd Tuesday of the month. Scouts scheduling an Eagle Board of Review must have their completed Eagle Rank Application submitted to the Jefferson Service Center a minimum of two weeks prior to their scheduled appointment. Be sure to bring three copies of your workbook, application and Life Ambition Statement on the evening of your Eagle Board.

Scouts scheduling a Project Review do not need to submit their workbooks to the Jefferson Service Center and should bring two extra copies with you on the night of the Project Review.

If you have questions that have not been answered, please contact the Etowah District Advancement Committee Chair, Bill Talbot, via email at <advancement@etowah-bsa.org>
